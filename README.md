# Getting Started
This game is Mole Mayhem Is a fast paced reaction time game. It is our a take on whack-O-mole. You will be timed and must hit as many moles as you can!

# Project Overview        

How to play:

Playing Mole Mayhem is simple. Martin and his friends having plotting for you land. DON‚ÄôT let them take over your beautiful lawn. You need to hit 10 moles as fast as you can. You will be timed! 
Once you hit 10 the game will end display your score as well as previous score. 


# Favorite Code and Its Challeneges

Katie:

The hardest part of the code on my part was the making the stopwatch and working out the object for that.
```
update() {
    let currentMillis = millis();
    let timeSince = currentMillis - this.lastMillis;
    this.milliseconds += timeSince;

    if(this.milliseconds >= 1000){
      this.seconds += 1;
      this.milliseconds -= 1000;
    }
    if(this.seconds === 60){
      this.minutes += 1;
      this.seconds = 0;
    }
    this.lastMillis = currentMillis;
  }
  totalTime() {
    return this.milliseconds + this.seconds * 1000 + this.minutes * 60000;
  }
```

Helina: 

The code I am most proud of is, My favorite part of the code is setting up the background or the ‚Äúlawn‚Äù. My favorite part of the code is setting up the background or the ‚Äúlawn‚Äù. And also moving from our title slide, to our game, then the list of HighScore (had help from mark)

```
if(state.isTitle()) {
    titleSlide.draw();
  }
  if(state.isRun()) {
    imageMode(CORNER);
    image(Bgimg, 0, 0, width, height, 10, 0, Bgimg.width, Bgimg.height, COVER);

    for(const clock of clocks) {
      clock.draw();
      clock.update();
    }
    for(const mole of moles) {
      mole.update();
      mole.draw();
    }
    moleScore.draw();
    textSize(32);
    text('üî®', mouseX, mouseY);

    if(moleScore.score === 10 && state.isRun()) {
      state.setEnd();
      bestTimes.updateNewTimes(clocks[0].totalTime());
    }

  }
  if(state.isEnd()) {
    background('RosyBrown');
    textSize(60),
    textFont('Palatino');
    fill('SaddleBrown');
    text("Highscores!", 40, 120);
    textSize(20);
    text("Hit ENTER to play again!", 85, 300);
    bestTimes.draw();
  }
}

function mouseClicked() {
  const mole = moles[0];
  if(dist(mouseX, mouseY, mole.x, mole.y) < mole.size) {
    moleScore.scoreUp();
    mole.move();
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
 if(keyCode === ENTER && !state.isRun()) {
    state.setRun();
    moleScore.reset();
    userStartAudio();
    if(audioStarted === false) {
      audio.play(); //Starts the background music
      audio.loop(); //Will keep music playing
      audioStarted = true;
    }
    clocks[0].reset();
    clocks[0].running = true;
  }
}
```

The hardest part of our code for me, was getting the sound to work in the right spot. I wanted the sound to start and stop where I wanted to without interferring with the other code.
```
function preload() {
  Bgimg = loadImage('background.png');
  soundFormats("mp3"); //Will format the audio
  audio = loadSound("best-game-console.mp3");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(220);
  clocks.push(new Clock());
  moles.push(new Mole());
  scoreboard = new Scoreboard();
  audio.play(); //Starts the background music
  audio.loop(); //Will keep music playing
  noCursor(); 
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  if(keyCode === ENTER) {
    gameStart = true;
    gameEnd = false;
    userStartAudio();
  }
```

# What We Did Differently
We used state in our previous game,  however, this time around we had a better understanding of it on what we could make it do. 
```
function keyPressed() {
  if(keyCode === ENTER && gameStart === false && gameEnd === false) {
    gameStart = true;
    gameEnd = false;
    userStartAudio();
    audio.play(); //Starts the background music
    audio.loop(); //Will keep music playing
  }
}
```
We wanted to have best times displayed at the end, so we used a higher order procedure sort() to modify the elements in the array.
```
class RecentTimes {
  constructor() {
    this.topTimes = [];
  }
  updateNewTimes(newTimeMillis) {
    this.topTimes.push(newTimeMillis);
		this.topTimes.sort(function(a,b) {
      return a - b;
    });
  }
```

We did find a way to incorporate classes from our unit object oriented programming for our mole.
```
class Clock {
  constructor () {
    this.lastMillis = 0;
    this.milliseconds = 0;
    this.seconds = 0;
    this.minutes = 0;
    this.running = true;
  }
  update() {
    let currentMillis = millis();
    let timeSince = currentMillis - this.lastMillis;
    this.milliseconds += timeSince;

    if(this.milliseconds >= 1000){
      this.seconds += 1;
      this.milliseconds -= 1000;
    }
    if(this.seconds === 60){
      this.minutes += 1;
      this.seconds = 0;
    }
    this.lastMillis = currentMillis;
  }
  totalTime() {
    return this.milliseconds + this.seconds * 1000 + this.minutes * 60000;
  }
  
  draw(){
    let visibleMilliseconds = floor(this.milliseconds / 10);
    fill('pink');
    text(nf(this.minutes, 2) + ":" + nf(this.seconds, 2) + ":" + nf(visibleMilliseconds, 2), (width / 2) - 75, 25);
  }
}
```
